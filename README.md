# Couchbase Lite Gluon Example

This is an example of creating a Java Gluon application that makes use of the Couchbase Lite SDK.  Much of the code is similar to that found in the [JavaFX example](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-lite-javafx-example).

## Running the Application

Gluon applications work through Gradle rather than similar Java tools like Maven.  The application can be run by using the command line or an IDE with appropriate such as IntelliJ with proper Gradle support.

To run this application via a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac and Linux), execute the following:

```sh
./gradlew run
```

The above command will download all dependencies and launch the application.
